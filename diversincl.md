# Diversity & Inclusion

Common tech companies tend to fail to include two groups:
  - women
  - minorities 

### Male Dominated Society 
The reason why there aren't any females in the software development world is because a lot of interests that lead up to software development caters to the male gender from the beginning of software development even at an early age. (e.g. Gameboys) 

It's common for women to stay out of the tech industry, or quit before even making it a year, because there was not a lot of catering to the feminine gender. If a woman were to attempt to pursue the career, she would begin at a state of being more behind than her male counterparts. If a women were to have pursued a tech career, a lot of times she gets overlooked because it's so abnormal for a woman to be in the tech environment. 

> Personally, after reading these articles I have noticed that a lot of my growing up was actually very "masculine"- at least in the tech world. I had my own Gameboy as a child and dabbled with code during my free time as an adolescent. Reading the third article really opened my eyes to how it helped me with wanting to become a software developer because I essentially had a "boy" childhood. I just never realized it. (CRAZY!)

### Minorities in Tech
Another thing that tech companies struggle with is the lack of minorities in the tech environment. I was not able to find the exact reason to why, but it's very evident that although some companies may be more diverse than others, there's always a ethnicity that takes up the majority of employees at a tech company.

Having the lack of diversity cause companies to be unable to cater to different types of people than the type they employ. Essentially companies cut off connecting to clients of minorities as well as having an employee who can look at things from a different perspective and enrich the work environment.
